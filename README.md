## View-First Development

Pakyow lets you start with a view and build the app on top. Here's how it works:

- Generate your app and immediately create views using HTML or your favorite template language.
- Start the app and see the views in your local browser without adding any back-end code.
- Add back-end code without changing any of the previously created views.

This process gets you right to work, reducing friction to keep the project moving forward.
