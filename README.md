# Pakyow Framework [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/pakyow/chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/pakyow/chat)

Pakyow is a framework for building modern websites and web apps. Views update in
realtime to stay in sync with backend state. This is done using a traditional,
backend-driven architecture. Business logic is written once and stays on the
server, which means you write no JavaScript.

Pakyow is designed with progressive enhancement in mind. Because views are
rendered on the server, they remain accessible to users who are using
unsupported browsers. The realtime layers is simply turned off.

There are three core concepts you should be familiar with:

1. View-First Development
