# Pakyow Web Framework [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/pakyow/chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/pakyow/chat)

Pakyow lets you build modern apps that don't break the web.

It provides features such as auto-updating views while embracing traditional
concepts like progressive enhancement. Designed to be as simple as possible, it
helps you quickly create momentum and maintain it throughout a project.

**Embraces the new web (without breaking it).**  
Views automatically stay in sync with the server, with no extra code. Pakyow
brings progressive enhancement to the modern web.

**Removes friction from development.**  
Quickly build a prototype with only HTML and CSS. Later on, build right on top
of the prototype without throwing out previous work.

**Accessible to everyone.**  
Pakyow makes it a little bit easier to get started. We believe that a simpler
web empowers more contribution, leading towards a more democratic web.
