# Introduction

Pakyow is an open-source framework for building modern web-apps in Ruby. It
helps you build working software faster with a development process that remains 
friendly to both designers and developers. It's built for getting along.

*Pakyow empowers the designer with a view-first development process.*

## Own the front-end
The views are created in isolation from the back-end app, giving the designer 
complete control over the front-end through the entire development process.

## Prototypes made easy
Create a working, navigable prototype of your app without writing a line of back-end 
code. Later, add the back-end as a layer on top of the view, leaving the prototype intact.

## Logicless views
Views describe what the UI is, not how it's built. Write views in HTML or the 
template language of your choice; no view logic and nothing new to learn.
