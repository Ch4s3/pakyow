# Pakyow v0.9

Pakyow is an open-source framework for the modern web. Build web-based apps faster with a view-first development
process that's friendly to everyone -- whether you're a designer or a developer. It's for getting along.

## View-First Development

Pakyow lets you start with a view and build the app on top. Here's how it works:

- Generate your app and immediately create a view, using HTML, HAML, or your favorite template language.
- Without adding any back-end code, start the app and view it locally in your browser.
- Add back-end code without changing any of the previously created views.

This process gets you right to work, reducing friction to keep the project moving forward.
